He has been working in the field of deep face analysis (e.g., efficient geometry estimation, photorealistic texture modelling, and robust feature embedding) with particular interests in building real-world working systems (e.g., [InsightFace.ai](http://insightface.ai/) and [Facesoft.io](https://craft.co/facesoft)). He also won many visual perception challenges (e.g., [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/challenges/beyond_ilsvrc) and [ActivityNet](http://activity-net.org/challenges/2017/program.html)) in the past years.
